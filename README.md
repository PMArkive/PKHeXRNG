# PKHeXRNG

A RNG Helper which connects to your modern Nintendo console/emulator for data reading.

## Usage

Create a `plugins` folder in the same location as your `PKHeX.exe` installation. Copy the built plugin dll to that folder, and launch PKHeX. PKHeX will then load the plugin, whose content can be accessed via the `Tools` dropdown.

PKM reading from offsets (a couple preprogrammed offset lists are provided) and mem dumping is available within the popup window.
